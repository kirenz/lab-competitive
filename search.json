Your task is to conduct a comprehensive competitive analysis.\nYou‚Äôll analyze key competitors and examine customer reviews and social media mentions to gauge public sentiment and identify any areas where your company could potentially gain a competitive advantage.\nThrough this process, you‚Äôll gain practical experience in data collection, quantitative analysis, and critical evaluation skills, which are crucial in strategic decision-making.\nFor this case study, we will create a fictional scenario where we have three major e-commerce competitors: E-ShopA, E-ShopB, and E-ShopC. We‚Äôll use SQL and Python for data analysis and visualization.\n\nTask description"
