Competitive Analysis in the E-commerce Industry

In this case study, you will step into the shoes of a market researcher for an e-commerce company. Your task is to conduct a comprehensive competitive analysis. 

You'll identify key competitors in the market and analyze their business strategies, customer base, pricing, marketing and advertising tactics, and overall online presence. You'll examine customer reviews and social media mentions to gauge public sentiment and identify any areas where your company could potentially gain a competitive advantage. 

Through this process, you'll gain practical experience in data collection, quantitative analysis, and critical evaluation skills, which are crucial in strategic decision-making.

For this case study, we will create a fictional scenario where we have three major e-commerce competitors: E-ShopA, E-ShopB, and E-ShopC. We'll use Python for data analysis and visualization.
