## Introduction to Altair-Vega

- Altair is a declarative statistical visualization library in Python.

- It's built on [Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/) and [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite-api/), which are visualization grammars built on top of [D3](https://d3js.org/). 


## Key features of Altair

- Simple API: Just a few lines of code can create beautiful visualizations.

- Integration with Pandas: Altair's API is designed to work with Pandas dataframes.

- Declarative Visualization: You describe the properties of a visualization and let Altair figure out how to implement it.


# Task Overview and Hints

## Task 1: Average Revenue by E-Shop

You're required to show the average revenue for all shops, using the name `average_revenue`.

**Hint:**

1. Import the Altair library.
2. Read the CSV data into a Pandas DataFrame.
3. Use `alt.Chart()` to create a chart.
4. Use `mark_bar()` to specify that you want a bar chart.
5. Use `encode()` to specify the X and Y axes. You can compute the average revenue using Altair's built-in `average()` function.


## Task 2: Two E-Shops with the Highest Average Rating

The task is to show the two E-Shops with the highest average rating, using the name \`average_rating\`.

**Hint:**

1. Group the data by 'eshop_name' and calculate the mean of 'average_rating' for each group.
2. Sort the results in descending order and pick the top 2.
3. Use the same charting methods as in Task 1 to visualize the data.


## Task 3: E-Shop Performance Over Time

You're tasked with showing the annual revenue per E-Shop by year, using the names \`year\` and \`total_revenue\`.

**Hint:**

1. Make sure the 'date' column is in a date-time format.
2. Extract the year from the 'date' column using the \`year()\` function in Altair.
3. To get the total revenue, use the \`sum()\` function in Altair.
4. Use \`mark_bar()\` for the chart type and encode the axes accordingly.


## Task 4: Maximum Social Media Followers

Your task is to show the maximum amount of social media followers for every E-shop in a descending order, using the name \`max_followers\`.

**Hint:**

1. Use the \`max()\` function in Altair to calculate the maximum number of social media followers for each E-shop.
2. Sort the E-shops by the 'y' axis in descending order when encoding the 'x' axis.


## Task 5: Monthly Time on Site overview

The final task is to show a monthly overview of the average time on site for every E-shop (ordered by E-shop and month), using the names \`month\` and \`average_time_on_site\`.

**Hint:**

1. Extract the month from the 'date' column using the \`month()\` function in Altair.
2. To get the average time on site, use the \`average()\` function in Altair.
3. Use \`mark_line()\` for the chart type and encode the axes accordingly.
